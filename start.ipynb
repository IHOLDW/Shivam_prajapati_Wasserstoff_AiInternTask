The location is remote or onsite, contact info is Divyansh Sharma, and there's an overview section. Then there's a checklist with several components including document processing, storage, search functionality, extracting answers, theme identification, code quality, and a demo video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user question is asking what the task of the internship is. The main points from the context are that as an AI intern, you'll develop a Generative AI application. Specific tasks include handling 75+ documents with various formats (PDF, text, images using OCR), storing them for fast search, allowing natural language queries, extracting and citing answers, identifying common themes across the documents, creating a web interface to manage documents and submit questions, searching through each document for answers, writing clean code, making a README, and producing a demo video.\n",

      "I need to make sure I cover all these points concisely. The user might be an applicant trying to understand what they're expected to do or someone preparing materials based on this task description.\n",

      "Also, the dataset can be any set of related documents like legal cases or research articles. Deployment options are free platforms such as Render, Railway, Replit, Hugging Face Spaces, Vercel. The recommended project structure includes backend directories for different components and deployment-related files.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the internship task is to build a Generative AI chatbot that processes multiple documents, allows users to ask natural language questions, retrieves answers with citations from each document, identifies common themes across all documents related to those queries, stores them in an organized way, and presents everything via a web interface. They need clean code, proper documentation, and a demonstration of the project.\n",

      "The internship task is to develop a **Generative AI chatbot** that can process and manage at least 75 documents in various formats (including PDF, text files, scanned images with OCR), store them for efficient searching, extract answers from the documents using natural language queries, cite these answers appropriately, identify common themes across all relevant documents, generate synthesized summaries based on user questions, and consolidate responses accordingly. The project must be implemented as a full-time 6-month internship role at Wasserstoff company, featuring a clean UI with well-commented code and proper documentation (README).\n"
